    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Simple AAC ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application ("App").
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Simple AAC does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.</strong> All data is stored locally on your device only. We do not have access to any information stored in the App.
        </p>
        <p>
            The App stores the following data locally on your device:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Communication boards and buttons</li>
            <li>Custom photos and images</li>
            <li>Routines and customizations</li>
            <li>User preferences and settings</li>
            <li>Usage data (stored locally only, never transmitted)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>No Tracking or Analytics</h2>
        <p>
            We do not use analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs. We do not track your usage, behavior, or any other information. The App operates entirely offline and does not send any data to external servers.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>No Cloud Storage</h2>
        <p>
            All data including boards, buttons, photos, routines, and settings are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to your data, and it is never uploaded to any cloud service or external server.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>
            Subscription purchases are processed through Apple App Store or Google Play Store. We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions, which only handles receipt validation. RevenueCat may collect minimal information necessary for subscription management (such as purchase receipts), but no personal information is required to use the App.
        </p>
        <p>
            For information about how Apple and Google handle subscription data, please refer to their respective privacy policies:

            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>COPPA Compliance</h2>
        <p>
            This App is designed for children and complies with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act). We do not collect any information from children. All data remains on the device and is never transmitted or shared.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The App uses the following third-party services:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Subscription management and receipt validation only. No personal data is shared.</li>
            <li><strong>ARASAAC:</strong> Free symbol library accessed via public API. No authentication or personal data required.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            You can delete all App data at any time through the App settings. This will permanently remove all profiles, boards, photos, and routines from your device. Deleted data cannot be recovered.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            Since all data is stored locally on your device, data security is managed by your device's operating system security features. We recommend:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
            <li>Using device-level encryption if available</li>
            <li>Regularly backing up your device</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
